:hp-tags: PowerDNS, MySQL, Debian 8

After longtime use many DNS service, it just a time to setup my own DNS server and i'll provide a DNS service soon.
Since Debian 8 is stable now, i'll stick with this OS. My plan is setup 2 server for the DNS and make it work.

Now everything work and my nameserver is:
----
ns1.sang.io	123.30.105.66
ns2.sang.io	123.30.129.5
----

Here is the setup, it very easy.

== Install MySQL server
----
apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
----

== Install PowerDNS with MySQL backend
----
apt-get install pdns-server pdns-backend-mysq
service pdns start
----

Now you can see my domain is using dns from server i setup powerdns. I'll write information about how to setup DNSSEC with PowerDNS.
